# Case-Closed
Packing a bag can be stressful, time-consuming, and depending on the type or size of the luggage, it becomes extremely 
difficult to weight it without the proper equipment. Airlines have become very strict when it comes to size and weight 
of check-in luggage, and baggage fines get steeper every year. This project has the objective of simplifying a hard 
task by giving the user the proper tool to solve the problem. A huge benefit from this design is that the individual won't 
need to finish packing to know if the luggage is overweight. The real-time feedback implemented with the smartphone app will 
enable the user to know when the bag has reached its weight limit.
